Today we are opening a new era in soft3. We are launching a second GPU network based on cyber-sdk. Why is it important?  

## memecoin

We have a vision for PUSSY.

We are creating a planet-scale organism. Looking into nature we can find similarities in how our organism evolved and compare it with how existing blockchains are evolving. We now have core components: the backbone, the nervous system, and the rudiments of the brain. But how will this organism reproduce? That is why we need a pussy. I envision space pussy as a symbol of resistance against the weaknesses of our society. With the space pussy meme everyone must ask yourself: how does it happen that we are ashamed about the thing which is the source of life for us? This is a sign that something is wrong in our culture.

We can have a meme coin with balls.

cyber-sdk - is one of the most powerful stack in the blockchain universe with sequential and parallel computing, autonomous execution, and impressive social tools, including cyb.ai. So it is not a primitive doge, or shiba. It is a powerful collaborative computer. butterflies in the stomach what the community can do with space pussy.

You asked us to launch `space-pussy`.

And we realized that it is cool idea to create a community-led soft3 computer. It must be cheaper and more fun. It has a simple distribution that will focus solely on cosmos communities. The total supply is 1 exa PUSSY. You will be able to mint liquid pussy during staking. Now we have 18 heroes in Genesis. Every hero in genesis got 0.1% of PUSSY. The rest is in the community pool. All tokens will be gifted without a lock to the most active cosmos communities. It will be defined in collaboration with communities and happens in a month or so. Preliminarily: Cosmos, Osmosis, Juno, Secret, Evmos, Bostrom, Stargaze, Terra, and Desmos.  

## IKP Playground

There is a serious thing behind space pussy. We created soft3 architecture. A key component is Inter Knowledge protocol. It is a convention over IBC to sync the knowledge. Rise your hands who saw our talk at cosmoverse? I would recommend you to watch it. 

But in short, soft3 is the new consensus computing architecture that marries modern computing paradigms: conventional computing, ai, and web3. In essence, it is a general purpose onchain GPU accelerated graph database.

So in order to move the idea further, we need a second network for bidirectional experiments.

Superintelligence must not suffer in the cosmos alone without the ability to talk with creatures like him.

The cool thing about IKP is that it can be unidirectional. So your network must not have GPUs in order to be empowered by soft3. That is why during hackwasm Desmos created a case for unidirectional IKP.

Thank you Desmos team for recognizing the opportunities behind soft3 and creating this cool case. I invite Leo to demonstrate how it works!

## Launch training

We are dreamers! And we have a dream to launch blockchains like a rocket. Sometimes it is a huge engineering effort. So we are on our road to creating this culture. Think about it. You are launching the thing which could live longer than you. It deserves the show. It must be fun. With the fast launch of space pussy we decide to reuse the part from Bostrom network launch. The moment you love the most. Enjoy.
